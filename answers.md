# 7.3
The answers to 7.3 is in the files:
CLex.fsl - where there is the word "for"
CPar.fsy - all places it says "FOR"
Absyn.fs - where it says ForLoop
Interp.fs - where the comment (* THIS IS EXERCISE 7.3 *) is at

Then we also had to change all files from 7.2 from while loops into for loops:
MicroC/arrsum.c
MicroC/squares_for_loop.c
MicroC/histogram_for_loop.c
